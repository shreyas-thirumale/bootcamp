1. “What is the difference between Git and GitHub?”
2. “What’s the difference between ‘git add <file>’, ‘git add .’, and ‘git add -A’
3. “What does git push do? What does git pull do?”
4. “What’s the difference between fetch and pull?”

1. Git is a version control system while allows you to host Git repositories online 
to be shared, stored, and collaborated on.
2. Git add <file> adds a specific file to the staging area. git add . adds all changes
in the current directory and its subdirectories. git add -A Adds all changes across 
the entire repository, including deletions, even outside the current directory.
3. git push uploads your commits to a remote repository, such as one hosted on GitHub. 
git pull fetches the commits from a remote repository and merges with your local branch.
4. Fetch gets the commits from a remote repository but doesn't merge it with your local
branch. Pull gets the commits and merges it with your local branch.
